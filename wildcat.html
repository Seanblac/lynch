    <h1>what is the point of life if what we do at the end is die!</h1>
    <p>There has been several theories on what we should do as individuals, <br>
        so many echo chambers, professors and geniuses has tried for so many years to educate people<br>
        on what we should do as individuals at the end it all comes down to death </p>
    <h2>why are we here on earth?</h2>
    <p> I believe all our struggles are ultimately our strength in disguise, because <br>
        on careful observation of all the tings we go through in life we tends to develop <br>
        our strength form the struggles we go
        through </p>
    </p>

    <h2>Is is worth it?</h2>
    <p>i believe its worth it if we do exactly what we want to do with our life,<br> that is folow our passion and go
        through with things want to do, <br> we will live a fulfillled life filled with oy as e wont work a day in our
        life
        if we follow through with our passion</p>
    <h2>how do we know we are on the right track!</h2>
    <p>wehn you wake up in the morning and you are happy and filled with joy to statrt what you call your job, then you
        are on the right track <br>
        you can also be called a proffessional in the filled of what you studied but choose to follow thriugh with what
        <br>
        you live doing, in as much as you can take care of your self and your responsibilities then you are good to go!
